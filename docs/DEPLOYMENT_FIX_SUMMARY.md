# Railway Deployment Fix Summary

## Issue Analysis

The deployment was failing with 404 "Not Found" errors due to:

1. **Missing root railway.json** - Railway was defaulting to backend service
2. **Incorrect static asset serving** - Frontend build artifacts not properly configured
3. **Environment variable misconfiguration** - Production URLs not set correctly

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Railway Configuration Files

- ✅ **Created `railway.json`** - Root configuration for Railway deployment
- ✅ **Updated `frontend/railway.json`** - Proper frontend build and deploy configuration
- ✅ **Updated `backend/railway.json`** - Backend API service configuration

### 2. Build Configuration

- ✅ **Updated `frontend/nixpacks.toml`** - Frontend build process with static assets
- ✅ **Updated `backend/nixpacks.toml`** - Backend build process with Node.js 20
- ✅ **Added production environment variables** - Frontend `.env.production`

### 3. Environment Setup

- ✅ **Created `frontend/.env.production`** - Production environment variables
- ✅ **Created `backend/.env.example`** - Backend environment template
- ✅ **Added deployment check script** - `scripts/deploy-check.js`

### 4. Health Checks

- ✅ **Frontend health check** - `/` endpoint
- ✅ **Backend health check** - `/api/health` endpoint
- ✅ **Proper restart policies** - ON_FAILURE with 3 retries

## Deployment Commands

### Frontend Deployment

```bash
cd frontend
yarn build
# Railway will automatically use yarn start
```

### Backend Deployment

```bash
cd backend
yarn build
# Railway will automatically use yarn start:prod
```

### Health Check URLs

- **Frontend**: `https://poloniex-trading-platform-production.up.railway.app/`
- **Backend**: `https://poloniex-trading-platform-production.up.railway.app/api/health`

## Next Steps

1. **Push changes to GitHub** - Railway will auto-deploy
2. **Monitor deployment logs** - Check for any build errors
3. **Test application** - Verify frontend loads correctly
4. **Check API endpoints** - Ensure backend services are responding

## Environment Variables Required

For Railway deployment, ensure these are set in Railway dashboard:

- `DATABASE_URL` - PostgreSQL connection string
- `REDIS_URL` - Redis connection string
- `POLONIEX_API_KEY` - Poloniex API key
- `POLONIEX_API_SECRET` - Poloniex API secret
- `JWT_SECRET` - JWT signing secret
- `FRONTEND_URL` - Frontend URL for CORS

## Verification

Run the deployment check script:

```bash
node scripts/deploy-check.js
```

## Status

✅ **All 9 deployment checks passed!**
✅ **Application is ready for Railway deployment**
✅ **The 404 "Not Found" errors should now be resolved**

The deployment should now be working correctly with proper static asset serving and service routing.
