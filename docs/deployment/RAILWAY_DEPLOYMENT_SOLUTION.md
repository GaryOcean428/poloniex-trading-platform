# Railway Deployment Solution - Complete Implementation

## Problem Statement Summary

Railway backend deployment was failing during Docker image export with "context canceled" errors. The root cause was configuration ambiguity: `railpack.json` defined a monorepo with multiple services, but the Railway service itself didn't explicitly specify which service to deploy, causing Railpack to build the entire monorepo and create an oversized Docker context that timed out during export.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Railway Configuration File (railway.json)

Created a version-controlled Railway configuration file at the repository root:

```json
{
  "$schema": "https://railway.com/railway.schema.json",
  "build": {
    "builder": "RAILPACK",
    "buildCommand": "yarn install --immutable && yarn bundle:shared && yarn workspace backend build",
    "watchPatterns": [
      "backend/**/*.ts",
      "backend/**/*.js",
      "shared/**/*.ts",
      "backend/package.json",
      "package.json",
      "yarn.lock"
    ]
  },
  "deploy": {
    "startCommand": "cd backend && node dist/src/index.js",
    "healthcheckPath": "/api/health",
    "healthcheckTimeout": 300,
    "restartPolicyType": "ON_FAILURE",
    "restartPolicyMaxRetries": 3
  }
}
```

**Benefits:**
- ✅ Version-controlled configuration
- ✅ Explicit build and deployment commands
- ✅ Health check monitoring enabled
- ✅ Automatic restart on failures
- ✅ Watch patterns for efficient rebuilds

### 2. Deployment Validation Script

Created `scripts/validate-railway-deployment.mjs` to validate configuration before deployment:

**Features:**
- ✓ Checks Railway configuration files exist
- ✓ Validates health endpoint implementation
- ✓ Verifies Node.js version (22.11.0)
- ✓ Validates railpack.json configuration
- ✓ Validates railway.json configuration
- ✓ Provides clear success/failure indicators

**Usage:**
```bash
yarn railway:validate
```

**Expected Output:**
```
✅ All checks passed - Ready to deploy!
```

### 3. Optimized Build Configuration

Added `build:railway` script to backend package.json:

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "build:railway": "yarn run prebuild && rm -rf dist && tsc -p tsconfig.build.json --incremental false --sourceMap false --removeComments true && rm -rf .shared-build"
  }
}
```

**Optimizations:**
- ❌ Disabled incremental builds (Railway doesn't benefit from them)
- ❌ Disabled source maps (reduces build size)
- ❌ Removed comments (reduces build size)
- ✅ Result: 604KB build output (smaller and faster)

### 4. Package.json Scripts

Added convenience scripts to root package.json:

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "railway:validate": "node scripts/validate-railway-deployment.mjs",
    "railway:deploy": "yarn railway:validate && git push origin main"
  }
}
```

### 5. Comprehensive Documentation

Created three documentation files:

1. **RAILWAY_SERVICE_CONFIG.md** - Step-by-step Railway service configuration guide
2. **RAILWAY_MCP_USAGE.md** - Guide for using Railway MCP tools
3. **RAILWAY_DEPLOYMENT_SOLUTION.md** - This document

## Railway Service Configuration Steps

### Critical: Manual Configuration Required in Railway Dashboard

The Railway service `polytrade-be` needs these settings configured:

1. **Root Directory**: `backend`
   - Location: Service Settings → Root Directory
   - This isolates backend service deployment

2. **Build Command**: `yarn install --immutable && yarn bundle:shared && yarn workspace backend build:railway`
   - Location: Service Settings → Build Command
   - Uses optimized build for production

3. **Start Command**: `node dist/src/index.js`
   - Location: Service Settings → Start Command
   - Starts the compiled backend server

4. **Environment Variables** (Required):
   ```bash
   NODE_ENV=production
   PORT=${{PORT}}
   DATABASE_URL=<your-database-url>
   JWT_SECRET=<generate-with-openssl-rand-base64-32>
   LOG_LEVEL=info
   CORS_ORIGIN=<your-frontend-domain>
   FRONTEND_URL=<your-frontend-domain>
   FRONTEND_STANDALONE=true
   ```

### Generate JWT Secret

```bash
openssl rand -base64 32
```

## Deployment Workflow

### Before Each Deployment

1. **Validate Configuration**
   ```bash
   yarn railway:validate
   ```

2. **Build Backend** (if not already built)
   ```bash
   yarn build:backend
   ```

3. **Commit Changes**
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "feat: your changes"
   ```

4. **Deploy**
   ```bash
   yarn railway:deploy
   # Or simply: git push origin main
   ```

### Monitoring Deployment

1. **Watch Railway Logs**
   - Go to Railway dashboard
   - Select polytrade-be service
   - View deployment logs

2. **Check Health Endpoint**
   ```bash
   curl https://your-service.railway.app/api/health
   ```

   Expected response:
   ```json
   {
     "status": "healthy",
     "timestamp": "2025-01-02T...",
     "environment": "production"
   }
   ```

## Expected Success Indicators

### Build Phase ✅
```
✓ Successfully prepared Railpack plan
✓ Yarn 4.9.2 activated via Corepack
✓ Dependencies installed with yarn install --immutable
✓ Shared modules bundled
✓ Backend built successfully (604KB)
```

### Export Phase ✅
```
✓ Exporting to docker image format
✓ Image layers committed
✓ Export completed in < 30s
```

### Deployment Phase ✅
```
✓ Deployment successful
✓ Health check passed (200 status)
✓ Service running on 0.0.0.0:${PORT}
```

## Troubleshooting Guide

### Build Fails - Yarn Not Found
**Symptom:** `sh: 1: yarn: not found`

**Solution:**
- Verify Node version is 22.11.0 or higher
- Railway auto-enables Corepack for Yarn 4.9.2
- Check build command includes proper setup

### Export Fails - Context Timeout
**Symptom:** `"context canceled"` during export

**Solution:**
- Verify Root Directory is set to `backend` in Railway settings
- This ensures only backend files are in Docker context
- Check that build completed successfully

### Health Check Fails
**Symptom:** Railway shows unhealthy status

**Solution:**
- Verify backend binds to `0.0.0.0:${PORT}` (already configured)
- Check health endpoint at `/api/health` returns 200
- Confirm healthCheckPath in Railway is `/api/health`

### Service Won't Start
**Symptom:** Service crashes on startup

**Solution:**
- Verify start command is `node dist/src/index.js`
- Check environment variables are set correctly
- Review service logs for error messages
- Ensure DATABASE_URL and JWT_SECRET are configured
