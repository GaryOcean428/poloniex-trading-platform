# URGENT: Railway UI Configuration Fix

## 🚨 **Deployment Failures Confirmed**

Your deployment logs show the **exact issue** our documentation predicted:

### **Error Analysis:**
- ❌ **polytrade-fe**: `"No project found in /app"` - Building from repo root instead of `./frontend`
- ❌ **polytrade-be**: `"No project found in /app"` - Building from repo root instead of `./backend`  
- ❌ **ml-worker**: `"requirements.txt not found"` - Building from repo root instead of `./python-services/poloniex`

## 🔧 **Immediate Action Required: Railway UI Configuration**

### **Step 1: Configure polytrade-fe**
1. Go to Railway Dashboard → **polytrade-fe** service
2. Click **Settings** → **Service Settings**
3. Find **"Root Directory"** field
4. Set to: `frontend` (NOT `./frontend`)
5. Click **Save**

### **Step 2: Configure polytrade-be**
1. Go to Railway Dashboard → **polytrade-be** service
2. Click **Settings** → **Service Settings**
3. Find **"Root Directory"** field
4. Set to: `backend` (NOT `./backend`)
5. Click **Save**

### **Step 3: Configure ml-worker**
1. Go to Railway Dashboard → **ml-worker** service
2. Click **Settings** → **Service Settings**
3. Find **"Root Directory"** field
4. Set to: `python-services/poloniex` (NOT `./python-services/poloniex`)
5. Click **Save**

## ⚠️ **Critical Notes:**

### **Do NOT include leading `./`**
- ✅ **Correct**: `frontend`
- ❌ **Incorrect**: `./frontend`

### **Use forward slashes for nested paths**
- ✅ **Correct**: `python-services/poloniex`
- ❌ **Incorrect**: `python-services\poloniex`

## 🔄 **After Configuration:**

### **Expected Build Success Indicators:**
- ✅ `yarn install` finds `package.json` in correct directory
- ✅ `pip install -r requirements.txt` finds file in correct directory
- ✅ "Successfully prepared Railpack plan" continues to appear
- ✅ No more "No project found in /app" errors

### **Test Commands After Fix:**
1. **Trigger new deployment** for each service
2. **Monitor build logs** for successful package installation
3. **Verify** no path resolution errors

## 📋 **Verification Checklist:**

After making Railway UI changes, verify each service shows:

### **Frontend (polytrade-fe):**
- [ ] Finds `package.json` in correct directory
- [ ] `yarn install --immutable` succeeds
- [ ] `yarn build:deploy` executes
- [ ] Deploys successfully

### **Backend (polytrade-be):**
- [ ] Finds `package.json` in correct directory  
- [ ] `yarn install --immutable` succeeds
- [ ] `yarn build` executes
- [ ] Deploys successfully

### **ML Worker (ml-worker):**
- [ ] Finds `requirements.txt` in correct directory
- [ ] `pip install -r requirements.txt` succeeds
- [ ] Service starts successfully

## 🎯 **Why This Happened:**

Railway UI settings override Railpack configuration. Even with perfect `railpack.json` files, Railway needs to know which directory to use as the build context for each service.

This is exactly what our documentation warned about - **Manual Railway UI configuration is required**.

## 📞 **Next Steps:**

1. **Fix Railway UI settings** (above steps)
2. **Trigger new deployments**
3. **Verify success** using checklist
4. **Report back** with new deployment results

Your Railpack configuration is **perfect** - this is purely a Railway UI setting issue.
