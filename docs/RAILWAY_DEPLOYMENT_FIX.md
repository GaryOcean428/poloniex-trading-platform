# Railway Deployment Fix - Frontend (polytrade-fe)

## Issue Summary

The Railway deployment for `poloniex-trading-platform-production` was failing with the error:

```bash
error Cannot find the root of your workspace - are you sure you're currently in a workspace?
```

## Root Cause Analysis

### Primary Issue

The deployment failure was caused by **per-service railway.json files** in both `frontend/` and `backend/` directories that contained problematic `cd ..` commands:

```bash
cd .. && corepack enable && yarn install --immutable && yarn workspace poloniex-frontend build
```

### Why This Failed

1. **Build Context Broken**: The `cd ..` command changed the working directory, breaking the workspace context
2. **Workspace Resolution**: When Railway executes `cd ..`, it moves out of the project root where the `yarn.lock` and workspace configuration exist
3. **Mixed Yarn Versions**: The logs showed both Yarn 4.9.2 and Yarn 1.22.22, indicating version conflicts during the context switch

## Solution Implementation

### 1. Fixed Per-Service Railway Configurations

**Before (frontend/railway.json):**

```json
{
  "build": {
    "buildCommand": "cd .. && corepack enable && yarn install --immutable && yarn workspace poloniex-frontend build"
  },
  "deploy": {
    "startCommand": "cd .. && yarn workspace poloniex-frontend start"
  }
}
```

**After (frontend/railway.json):**

```json
{
  "build": {
    "buildCommand": "corepack enable && yarn install --immutable && yarn workspace poloniex-frontend build"
  },
  "deploy": {
    "startCommand": "yarn workspace poloniex-frontend start"
  }
}
```

### 2. Updated Backend Configuration Similarly

Removed `cd ..` commands from `backend/railway.json` and fixed watch patterns to use correct relative paths.

### 3. Ensured Consistent Workspace Naming

All workspace references now use the correct **package names**:

- `poloniex-frontend` (not `frontend`)
- `poloniex-backend` (not `backend`)

## Verification

### Local Testing Successful

```bash
$ yarn workspaces list
➤ YN0000: .
➤ YN0000: backend
➤ YN0000: frontend
➤ YN0000: Done in 0s 1ms

$ yarn workspace poloniex-frontend build
✓ built in 6.61s
```

## Deployment Instructions

### For Railway Redeploy

1. **Commit and push** these configuration changes to your repository
2. **Trigger a new deployment** on Railway (should now use the fixed configurations)
3. **Monitor the build logs** to confirm the workspace commands execute successfully

### Expected Build Flow

```bash
# Railway will now execute from the correct working directory:
corepack enable
yarn install --immutable
yarn workspace poloniex-frontend build
```

## Configuration Files Changed

- ✅ `/frontend/railway.json` - Removed `cd ..` commands
- ✅ `/backend/railway.json` - Removed `cd ..` commands
- ✅ `/package.json` - Ensured consistent workspace naming in scripts
- ✅ `/railway.json` - Root configuration aligned with workspace names

## Next Steps

1. **Push changes to repository**
2. **Redeploy on Railway**
3. **Verify successful deployment**
4. **Test the live application** at `poloniex-trading-platform-production.up.railway.app`

## Notes

- The root `railway.json` file provides environment-specific configurations
- Per-service `railway.json` files in `frontend/` and `backend/` directories take precedence for their respective services
- Yarn workspaces resolve by **package name**, not folder name
- Always ensure build commands execute from the proper workspace root context
