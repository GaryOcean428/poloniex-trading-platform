## **🚀 Quick Setup Commands**

### **1. Add Redis Service**
```bash
# Via Railway Dashboard
1. Go to: https://railway.com/project/[PROJECT-ID]
2. Click "New" → "Database" → "Redis"
3. Name: "redis-stack"
4. Wait 2-3 minutes for deployment
```

### **2. Verify Setup**
```bash
cd backend
railway variables  # Verify Redis env vars
railway run -- redis-cli -u $REDIS_URL ping  # Should return PONG
```

### **3. Redeploy with Redis**
```bash
railway up
railway run -- yarn node test-redis-integration.js  # Full test
```
