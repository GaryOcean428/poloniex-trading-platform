## Quick Fix for Users

**Option 1 (Recommended)**: In Railway Dashboard → Backend Service → Settings:
- Set `Root Directory` to: `/backend`
- Set `Config Path` to: `/railway.json`
- Set `Builder` to: `NIXPACKS`

**Option 2**: In Railway Dashboard → Backend Service → Settings:
- Set `Root Directory` to: `/backend`  
- Set `Config Path` to: `/backend/railway.json`
- Set `Builder` to: `NIXPACKS`

**Option 3** (Fallback): In Railway Dashboard → Backend Service → Settings:
- Set `Root Directory` to: `/backend`
- **Clear `Config Path` completely** (leave empty)
- Manually configure build/deploy settings in Railway UI

## Key Insights

1. **Config paths in Railway are always absolute** from repository root
2. **Root Directory and Config Path are separate settings** - Root Directory sets build context, Config Path specifies configuration file location
3. **All configuration files in the repository are valid** - the issue was purely a Railway dashboard configuration problem
4. **Multiple valid configuration approaches** exist for different use cases

## Testing Performed

- ✅ Verified all Railway configuration files exist and are valid
- ✅ Tested backend build and startup processes
- ✅ Confirmed health endpoints work correctly
- ✅ Validated new helper tools function properly
- ✅ Tested enhanced Railway startup script with debugging

## Tools for Users

Run these commands to get help:
```bash
yarn railway:help      # Get configuration guidance
yarn railway:validate  # Validate config files
```

**Issue Resolution**: The repository now provides comprehensive guidance and tools to resolve Railway configuration issues, with multiple fallback options to ensure deployment success.
