# 🚨 IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED: Fix Railway Backend (polytrade-be) Yarn Configuration

## Current Issue
Railway UI is overriding `railpack.json` and using `npm` instead of `yarn`, causing build failures.

## ✅ Action Steps (Do This Now)

### 1. Open Railway Dashboard
- Go to: https://railway.app/dashboard
- Navigate to: **Services** → **Backend (polytrade-be)**

### 2. Go to Build Settings
- Click: **Settings** tab
- Scroll to: **Build & Deploy** section

### 3. Clear ALL Override Fields
**IMPORTANT**: Clear these fields completely (don't just delete text - ensure fields are empty):

| Field | Action |
|-------|--------|
| **Install Command** | Clear/Delete all text - leave blank |
| **Build Command** | Clear/Delete all text - leave blank |
| **Watch Paths** | Clear/Delete all text - leave blank |

### 4. Save Changes
- Click: **Save** button at the bottom of the settings

### 5. Trigger Redeployment
- Go to: **Deployments** tab
- Click: **Redeploy** button (or push a commit to trigger)

## 🔍 Verification (After Redeployment)

### Check Deployment Logs
Look for these lines in the deployment logs:

✅ **CORRECT** (What you should see):
```bash
$ yarn --cwd .. install --check-cache
...
$ yarn run build
```

❌ **WRONG** (What you should NOT see):
```bash
$ npm install
$ npm run build
```

## 🚨 If Clearing Fields Doesn't Work

If Railway still uses npm after clearing, explicitly set these commands:

| Field | Command to Set |
|-------|----------------|
| **Install Command** | `corepack enable; corepack prepare yarn@4.9.2 --activate; yarn --cwd .. install --check-cache` |
| **Build Command** | `yarn run build` |

Then save and redeploy again.

## 📋 Configuration Context

Your backend has proper Yarn configuration:
- ✅ `backend/railpack.json` specifies Yarn 4.9.2
- ✅ `.yarnrc.yml` at root with correct Yarn path
- ✅ Yarn workspaces configured (monorepo setup)
- ✅ No conflicting `railway.toml` files
- ✅ Root `yarn.lock` manages all dependencies

The issue is purely Railway UI overriding these configurations.

## 🎯 Success Criteria

After fixing, your Railway deployment logs should show:
1. Yarn 4.9.2 being activated via corepack
2. Dependencies installed with `yarn install --check-cache`
3. Build executed with `yarn run build`
4. No npm commands anywhere in the logs

**Time Required**: ~5 minutes
**Urgency**: HIGH - Backend won't deploy correctly until fixed
