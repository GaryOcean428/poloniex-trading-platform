# Monorepo Tooling - Quick Start Guide

**TL;DR**: Your current setup is optimal. Use these new tools to enhance it.

---

## What's New?

We analyzed whether to adopt Nx, Bazel, or Pants for this monorepo. **Conclusion**: Your current Yarn Workspaces + Railpack setup is optimal for your scale (3 services, small team).

### New Capabilities Added ‚ú®

1. **Affected Workspace Detection** - Only test/build what changed
2. **Build Metrics Tracking** - Monitor performance over time
3. **Comprehensive Documentation** - Everything is now documented

---

## Quick Commands

### Affected Workspace Detection

```bash
# Show which workspaces changed
yarn affected

# Compare different commits
node scripts/affected.mjs origin/main HEAD
```

**Use Case**: CI optimization - only test services that changed

### Build Metrics

```bash
# Measure frontend build time
yarn build:metrics frontend

# Measure backend build time  
yarn build:metrics backend

# Analyze trends
yarn metrics:analyze
```

**Use Case**: Monitor build performance, get alerted to slowdowns

## Decision Matrix (Ultra-Quick Version)

| Your Situation | Recommendation |
|----------------|----------------|
| **Current**: 3 services, small team, <5 min builds | ‚úÖ **Keep Yarn Workspaces** |
| **5+ services** added | ‚ö†Ô∏è Evaluate Nx |
| **5+ developers** join | ‚ö†Ô∏è Evaluate Nx |
| **Build time >5 min** consistently | ‚ö†Ô∏è Evaluate Nx |
| **20+ services**, multi-language at scale | ‚ö†Ô∏è Evaluate Bazel/Pants |

---

## Why Not Nx or Bazel?

### Nx
- ‚úÖ Great for 5+ services with task orchestration needs
- ‚ùå You have 3 services - migration cost exceeds value
- üí∞ $8k-$15k to migrate (4-6 weeks)
- üìà Only positive ROI if you add 3+ more services

### Bazel/Pants
- ‚úÖ Great for 50+ services, Google-scale monorepos
- ‚ùå You have 3 services - massive overkill
- üí∞ $40k-$80k to migrate (2-3 months)
- üìà Negative ROI unless you reach 50+ services

---

## What You're NOT Missing

‚ùå Complex task dependency graphs (you don't have them)  
‚ùå Affected-only testing (‚úÖ now available via script)  
‚ùå Remote build caching (‚úÖ Railway provides this)  
‚ùå Visual dependency graphs (3 services are simple)  
‚ùå Cross-language hermetic builds (not needed)  

---

## Immediate Action Items (Optional)

These enhance your current setup without requiring migration:

### 1. Enable Affected-Only CI (1-2 days)

**Benefit**: Faster CI by only testing changed services

```yaml
# .github/workflows/ci.yml
- name: Detect affected
  run: node scripts/affected.mjs origin/main HEAD
- name: Test affected only
  run: |
    # Run tests only for affected workspaces
```

**Example**: See `.github/workflows/ci-affected.yml.example`

### 2. Start Tracking Build Metrics (1 day)

**Benefit**: Early warning if builds slow down

```bash
# Add to your workflow
yarn build:metrics frontend
yarn build:metrics backend

# Review quarterly
yarn metrics:analyze
```

### 3. Optimize Python with uv (2-3 days)

**Benefit**: 10-100x faster Python dependency resolution

```bash
# Install uv
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh

# Update python-services/poloniex/railpack.json
{
  "build": {
    "steps": [
      {"command": "pip install uv && uv sync"}
    ]
  }
}
```

## When to Revisit This Decision

### Quarterly Review Checklist

Check these metrics every 3 months:

- [ ] Service count (current: 3, threshold: 5+)
- [ ] Team size (current: small, threshold: 5+)
- [ ] Average build time (current: 2-5 min, threshold: 5+ min)
- [ ] CI/CD complexity (currently simple)

**If 2+ thresholds exceeded**: Re-evaluate Nx migration

### Build Health Alerts

Set up alerts for:
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Build time >5 minutes: Investigate
- üö® Build time >10 minutes: Critical - requires action

## FAQ

**Q: Is our setup outdated?**  
A: No! You're using modern tools (Yarn Berry 4, Vite 7, TypeScript 5). You just don't need enterprise-scale orchestration tools yet.

**Q: Should we prepare for Nx now?**  
A: No. Premature optimization wastes time. Nx migration takes 4-6 weeks when needed - not worth doing speculatively.

**Q: What if we grow quickly?**  
A: Monitor the metrics above. Nx migration is straightforward and can happen in 4-6 weeks when triggered.

**Q: Are we behind competitors?**  
A: No. Most successful startups use simple tools until scale demands otherwise. Premature complexity kills velocity.

**Q: How do I convince my team this is right?**  
A: Share `docs/TOOLING_RECOMMENDATIONS_SUMMARY.md` - it has cost-benefit analysis and industry benchmarks.
