## 🎯 Common Tasks

### "I want to understand if we should adopt Nx or Bazel"
👉 Read:
1. `DECISION_TREE.md` (5 min visual guide)
2. `TOOLING_RECOMMENDATIONS_SUMMARY.md` (10 min summary)
3. **Answer**: No, stick with current setup until you have 5+ services

### "How do I add a new service?"
👉 Read: `BUILD_ARCHITECTURE.md` → "Adding New Services"

### "Why are builds slow?"
👉 Read: `BUILD_ARCHITECTURE.md` → "Troubleshooting"
👉 Use: `yarn build:metrics analyze`

### "How does shared code work?"
👉 Read: `BUILD_ARCHITECTURE.md` → "Shared Code Strategy"

### "What's the deployment process?"
👉 Read: `deployment/RAILWAY_DEPLOYMENT_MASTER.md`

### "How do I detect affected workspaces?"
👉 Use: `yarn affected`
👉 Read: `MONOREPO_QUICKSTART.md`

---

## 🛠️ New Scripts & Tools

### Affected Detection
```bash
yarn affected
```
Detects which workspaces changed based on git diff.

**Implementation**: `../scripts/affected.mjs`  
**Documentation**: `MONOREPO_QUICKSTART.md`

### Build Metrics
```bash
yarn build:metrics frontend
yarn build:metrics backend
yarn metrics:analyze
```
Tracks build performance and analyzes trends.

**Implementation**: `../scripts/build-metrics.mjs`  
**Documentation**: `MONOREPO_QUICKSTART.md`

---

## 📊 Key Statistics

### Repository
- **Files**: 325 TypeScript/JavaScript, 6 Python
- **Services**: 3 (frontend, backend, ml-worker)
- **Size**: ~11MB
- **Build Time**: 2-5 minutes

### Documentation
- **Total Word Count**: 60,000+
- **Files**: 6 core documents
- **Scripts**: 2 utility scripts
- **Examples**: 1 CI workflow

---

## 🎓 Key Recommendations

### Current State: ✅ OPTIMAL
Your setup is perfect for your scale:
- 3 services (small enough for simple tools)
- Small team (familiar with standard tools)
- Railway deployment (optimized with Railpack)
- Fast builds (2-5 minutes)

### When to Reconsider: 🟡 MONITOR
Evaluate Nx if:
- Service count reaches 5+
- Team size reaches 5+ developers
- Build time exceeds 5 minutes consistently

### Never Consider: ❌ OVERKILL
Don't adopt Bazel/Pants unless:
- Service count exceeds 20
- Need hermetic multi-language builds
- Have dedicated build engineering team
