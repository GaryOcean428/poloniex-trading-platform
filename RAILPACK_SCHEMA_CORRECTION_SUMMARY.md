# Railpack Schema Correction Summary

## Overview

This document summarizes the comprehensive correction of railpack.json documentation and configuration files to match the official Railpack schema from https://schema.railpack.com.

## Problem Statement

The repository contained incorrect railpack.json structures that did not match the official Railpack schema. These issues were identified through verification against official Railpack documentation.

## Critical Issues Fixed

### 1. Incorrect Schema Structure

**❌ What Was Wrong:**
- `version` field that doesn't exist in schema
- `metadata` object that's not part of schema  
- `provider` nested under `build` (should be at root)
- `steps` nested under `build` (should be at root)
- Unsupported fields: `healthCheckPath`, `healthCheckTimeout`, `restartPolicyType`, `restartPolicyMaxRetries`

**✅ What's Correct:**
- `$schema` at top level pointing to https://schema.railpack.com
- `provider` at root level (e.g., "node" or "python")
- `packages` object for version control
- `steps` at root level (not nested)
- `deploy` section with proper structure
- `deploy.inputs` referencing previous steps

### 2. Version Information

**Updated:**
- Python version: Changed from "3.13" or "3.13+" to official default "3.13.2"
- Documentation now reflects Mise as the version manager (used by Railpack)

### 3. Health Check Configuration

**Clarified:**
- Health check fields (`healthCheckPath`, `healthCheckTimeout`) are NOT part of railpack.json schema
- Health checks should be configured in Railway UI, not railpack.json
- May be part of railway.json (separate Railway-specific config) or platform settings

## Correct Schema Structure

### Node.js Service Example

```json
{
  "$schema": "https://schema.railpack.com",
  "provider": "node",
  "packages": {
    "node": "20",
    "yarn": "4.9.2"
  },
  "steps": {
    "install": {
      "commands": [
        "corepack enable",
        "yarn install --frozen-lockfile"
      ]
    },
    "build": {
      "inputs": [{ "step": "install" }],
      "commands": ["yarn build"]
    }
  },
  "deploy": {
    "startCommand": "yarn start",
    "inputs": [{ "step": "build" }]
  }
}
```

### Python Service Example

```json
{
  "$schema": "https://schema.railpack.com",
  "provider": "python",
  "packages": {
    "python": "3.13.2"
  },
  "steps": {
    "install": {
      "commands": [
        "pip install -r requirements.txt"
      ]
    }
  },
  "deploy": {
    "startCommand": "uvicorn main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port $PORT",
    "inputs": [{ "step": "install" }]
  }
}
```

## Key Schema Points

1. **No version field** - This field doesn't exist in the official schema
2. **No metadata object** - Not part of the schema
3. **provider at root** - Not nested under `build`
4. **steps at root** - Not nested under `build`
5. **packages for versions** - Specifies exact versions (e.g., "node": "22")
6. **deploy.inputs** - References previous steps for layer composition
7. **buildAptPackages** - Root level for build-time apt packages (optional)
8. **deploy.aptPackages** - Runtime apt packages (optional)
9. **deploy.variables** - Environment variables (optional)
10. **deploy.paths** - PATH additions (optional)

## Build System Priority

Railway determines which build system to use in this order:
1. **Dockerfile** (if exists)
2. **railway.json** with builder config (if exists)
3. **Railpack** (auto-detection)

## Health Check Configuration

Health checks are configured in Railway UI, not railpack.json:
- **Backend**: `/api/health`
- **Frontend**: `/healthz` or `/`
- **Python**: `/health`

These can be set in:
- Railway dashboard service settings
- Possibly railway.json (separate from railpack.json)

## Validation

All configuration files have been validated:
```bash
jq -e . railpack.json                          # ✅ Valid
jq -e . frontend/railpack.json                 # ✅ Valid
jq -e . backend/railpack.json                  # ✅ Valid
jq -e . python-services/poloniex/railpack.json # ✅ Valid
```

## References

- **Official Railpack Schema**: https://schema.railpack.com
- **Primary Documentation**: `.agent-os/specs/railway-deployment-cheatsheet.md`
- **Configuration Guide**: `RAILWAY_CONFIGURATION.md`
- **Railpack Python Docs**: https://railpack.com/languages/python
- **Railpack Node Docs**: https://railpack.com/languages/node

## Recommendations

1. **Use the cheat sheet** (`.agent-os/specs/railway-deployment-cheatsheet.md`) as the primary reference
2. **Ignore outdated examples** in docs/RAILWAY_DEPLOYMENT_MASTER.md (kept for historical reference)
3. **Configure health checks** in Railway UI, not railpack.json
4. **Follow the official schema** structure for any new services
5. **Validate JSON** with `jq -e .` before committing changes

## Status: ✅ Complete

All railpack.json files and primary documentation now match the official Railpack schema. Outdated documentation has been annotated with warnings and directs readers to correct sources.
