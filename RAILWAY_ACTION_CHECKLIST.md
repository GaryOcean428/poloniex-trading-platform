# Railway Deployment - Quick Action Checklist

## What Was Fixed

✅ Updated railpack.json files to work with Railway Root Directory settings
✅ Fixed workspace dependency resolution for Node services  
✅ Fixed path resolution for Python service
✅ Added comprehensive documentation

## What You Need To Do NOW

### Step 1: Configure Railway Services (REQUIRED)

Go to each service in Railway UI and verify/set these configurations:

#### Backend Service (polytrade-be)
```
Root Directory: ./backend
Build Command: (leave empty)
Install Command: (leave empty)
Start Command: (leave empty)
Watch Paths: backend/**
```

#### Frontend Service (polytrade-fe)
```
Root Directory: ./frontend
Build Command: (leave empty)
Install Command: (leave empty)
Start Command: (leave empty)
Watch Paths: frontend/**
```

#### ML Worker Service (ml-worker)
```
Root Directory: ./python-services/poloniex
Build Command: (leave empty)
Install Command: (leave empty)
Start Command: (leave empty)
Watch Paths: python-services/poloniex/**
```

### Step 2: Clear Any Existing Command Overrides

For each service:
1. Go to Settings
2. Scroll to "Deploy" section
3. Ensure Build Command is empty
4. Ensure Install Command is empty
5. Ensure Start Command is empty
6. Save if you made any changes

### Step 3: Trigger New Deployments

For each service:
1. Go to the Deployments tab
2. Click "Deploy" or trigger via git push
3. Monitor the build logs

### Step 4: Verify Success

Watch the deployment logs for these success indicators:

**Backend:**
- ✅ "Successfully prepared Railpack plan"
- ✅ "Yarn package manager activated"
- ✅ "yarn install completed"
- ✅ "TypeScript compilation completed"
- ✅ "Flattened dist/src into dist/"
- ✅ "Starting: node dist/index.js"

**Frontend:**
- ✅ "Successfully prepared Railpack plan"
- ✅ "Yarn package manager activated"
- ✅ "yarn install completed"
- ✅ "Vite build completed"
- ✅ "Starting: node serve.js"

**ML Worker:**
- ✅ "Successfully prepared Railpack plan"
- ✅ "Python environment installed"
- ✅ "Created virtual environment"
- ✅ "pip install from requirements.txt completed"
- ✅ "Starting: uvicorn main:app"

## Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue: "No project found in /app"
**Solution:** Verify Root Directory is set to `./backend` (not empty, not `/`)

### Issue: "requirements.txt not found"
**Solution:** Verify Root Directory is set to `./python-services/poloniex`

### Issue: Commands still failing
**Solution:** 
1. Clear all Build/Install/Start command overrides in Railway UI
2. Clear Railway build cache
3. Redeploy
