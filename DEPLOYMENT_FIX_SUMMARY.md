# Backend Deployment Fix Summary

## Issue Fixed
âœ… Backend deployment failing with: `Error: Cannot find module '/app/dist/src/index.js'`

## Root Cause
The `backend/railpack.json` had an incorrect `startCommand` that didn't account for Railway's service root configuration.

### What Was Wrong
- **Incorrect**: `"startCommand": "node backend/dist/index.js"`
- **Problem**: When Railway uses service root `./backend`, the working directory is `/app/backend`, so the path `backend/dist/index.js` was trying to access `/app/backend/backend/dist/index.js`

### What's Now Correct
- **Fixed**: `"startCommand": "node dist/index.js"`
- **Working directory**: `/app/backend` (defined by root `railpack.json`)
- **Full path**: `/app/backend/dist/index.js` âœ…

## Changes Made

### 1. Fixed `backend/railpack.json`
```json
{
  "deploy": {
    "startCommand": "node dist/index.js",  // Changed from "node backend/dist/index.js"
    "healthCheckPath": "/api/health",
    "healthCheckTimeout": 300,
    "restartPolicyType": "ON_FAILURE",
    "restartPolicyMaxRetries": 3,
    "inputs": [{"step": "build"}]
  }
}
```

### 2. Added Build Verification
Added debug commands to the build step:
```json
{
  "build": {
    "commands": [
      "yarn workspace backend run build:railway",
      "echo '=== Build output verification ==='",
      "ls -la dist/",
      "echo '=== Checking for index.js ==='",
      "find dist -name 'index.js' -type f"
    ]
  }
}
```

This will help diagnose any future build output issues by showing the exact file structure.

### 3. Updated Documentation
- âœ… `AGENTS.md`: Corrected backend entry point reference
- âœ… `RAILWAY_CONFIGURATION.md`: Updated start command documentation
- âœ… `RAILWAY_DEPLOYMENT_CHECKLIST.md`: Fixed configuration settings
- âœ… `RAILWAY_ROOT_DIRECTORY_FIX.md`: Added deprecation warning

### 4. Added `.gitignore` Entry
Added `dist/` to `.gitignore` to prevent build artifacts from being committed to the repository.

## Verification

### Local Testing âœ…
```bash
$ cd backend && yarn build:railway
Flattened dist/src into dist/.

$ node dist/index.js
Error: Environment validation failed: DATABASE_URL environment variable is required
```

**Result**: The module is found successfully! The error is about missing environment variables, which is expected and correct behavior.

### Railway Deployment

When you push these changes, Railway will:

1. **Install dependencies** using corepack and yarn 4.9.2
2. **Build the backend** using the Railway-optimized build command
3. **Show build output** with the new debug commands
4. **Start the service** using `node dist/index.js`
5. **Health check** will probe `/api/health`

### Expected Build Logs

You should see output like:
```
=== Build output verification ===
total 60
drwxr-xr-x 13 runner runner 4096 Oct 24 10:19 .
drwxr-xr-x  7 runner runner 4096 Oct 24 10:19 ..
-rw-r--r--  1 runner runner 6443 Oct 24 10:19 index.js
drwxr-xr-x  2 runner runner 4096 Oct 24 10:19 config
drwxr-xr-x  2 runner runner 4096 Oct 24 10:19 routes
...

=== Checking for index.js ===
dist/index.js
dist/.shared-build/types/index.js
dist/shared/types/index.js
```

### Health Check
Once deployed, the health check at `/api/health` should return:
```json
{
  "status": "healthy",
  "timestamp": "2025-10-24T10:19:45.072Z",
  "environment": "production"
}
```

## How Railway Service Root Works

### Configuration
Root `railpack.json`:
```json
{
  "services": {
    "backend": {
      "root": "./backend"
    }
  }
}
```

### Execution Context
- **Repository root**: `/app`
- **Service root**: `/app/backend` (working directory for all commands)
- **Build output**: `/app/backend/dist/`
- **Entry point**: `/app/backend/dist/index.js`
- **Start command**: `node dist/index.js` (relative to `/app/backend`)

## Build Process Flow

1. **prebuild.mjs** - Copies shared modules to `.shared-build/`
2. **TypeScript compilation** - Outputs to `dist/src/`
3. **flatten-dist.mjs** - Moves `dist/src/*` to `dist/`
4. **Cleanup** - Removes `.shared-build/`
5. **Result**: Clean `dist/index.js` ready to run

## Next Steps

1. âœ… Push changes to Railway (already done via this PR)
2. ðŸ”„ Monitor Railway deployment logs
3. âœ… Verify health check returns 200 OK
4. âœ… Confirm service starts without module errors

## Troubleshooting

### If Module Not Found Error Persists
1. Check Railway service root setting (should be empty, let Railpack handle it)
2. Review build logs for the "Build output verification" section
3. Verify `dist/index.js` exists in the build output
4. Ensure `backend/railpack.json` has `"startCommand": "node dist/index.js"`

### If Health Check Fails
1. Verify all required environment variables are set in Railway
2. Check that the service is binding to `0.0.0.0:$PORT`
3. Review service logs for startup errors
4. Confirm `/api/health` endpoint is accessible
