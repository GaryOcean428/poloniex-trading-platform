# Polytrade: Autonomous Poloniex Futures Trading Platform

## Executive Summary
Polytrade is an autonomous futures trading system for Poloniex with full lifecycle support: data ingestion, research/backtesting, strategy evolution, paper trading, and live execution. The goal is a set-and-forget, highly reliable system with robust risk controls, continuous monitoring, and production-grade operations (Railway/Vercel).

This document captures the product vision, MVP scope, high-level architecture, and an implementation roadmap aligned to our engineering standards (TypeScript 5.5+, Node 22, React 19, Yarn 4, Vitest).

## Product Goals
- Fully autonomous live trading with strict risk and capital preservation
- Strategy research pipeline: backtesting, optimization, walk-forward validation
- Paper trading on real-time data with parity to live execution
- Production reliability: monitoring, alerting, self-healing, and HA

## MVP Scope
- High-fidelity backtesting with realistic execution (fees, funding, slippage)
- Strategy evolution (GA/DQN/ensemble) with guardrails to prevent overfitting
- Paper trading parity with live execution paths and metrics
- Live execution with risk controls (position sizing, drawdown, circuit breakers)
- Operational monitoring, health checks, and alerting

## Architecture Overview
- Frontend (React 19): dashboards for backtests, paper/live trading, strategy health, and risk
- Backend (Node 22/Express): services for market data, backtesting, execution, risk, and analytics
- Data Services: historical data pipeline (OHLCV, order book depth, funding, executions)
- Workers: scheduled tasks for validation, retraining, and reporting
- Infrastructure: Railway services (web, worker, data pipelines), volumes for persistence

## Key Risks & Mitigations
- Overfitting: walk-forward, out-of-sample tests, Monte Carlo, parameter stability checks
- Market regime shifts: regime detection, ensemble models, dynamic allocation
- Exchange/API instability: resilient websockets, fallbacks, retry/backoff, circuit breakers
- Latency/slippage: advanced execution strategies (TWAP/VWAP/iceberg), low-latency endpoints

## Initial Roadmap (16 weeks)
- Phase 1 (Weeks 1–4): Foundation upgrades (risk, monitoring, real-time metrics)
- Phase 2 (Weeks 5–8): Intelligence (multi-timeframe, sentiment, predictive ensemble)
- Phase 3 (Weeks 9–12): Operational excellence (self-healing, HA, enhanced Railway config)
- Phase 4 (Weeks 13–16): Optimization & scaling (performance, analytics, prod validation)

## Acceptance Criteria (MVP)
- Backtests match paper-trading performance within defined tolerance bands
- Live trades adhere to risk budgets and drawdown limits automatically
- System reports real-time health and self-heals common faults
- Deployment is repeatable with documented configs and environment checks
