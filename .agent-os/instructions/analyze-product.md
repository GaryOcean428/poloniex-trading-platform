# Analyze Product

Purpose: Add Agent OS to an existing codebase and map context.

Process:
- Detect package manager (Yarn 4 present)
- Map monorepo structure (frontend, backend, shared)
- Identify standards already in repo (ESLint, tsconfig)
- Record third-party services (Railway, Vercel, Supabase)
- List common scripts and dev ports

Output:
- Summary of architecture
- Risks and hotspots
- Proposed next steps for alignment with standards
