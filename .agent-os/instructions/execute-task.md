# Execute Task

Purpose: Implement a single atomic task with high quality.

Steps:
- Understand context: read spec + related code
- Plan: outline approach and potential risks
- Implement: minimal diff; add types, errors, and tests
- Verify: run TypeScript, lint, tests
- Document: update comments/README if needed

Do/Donâ€™t:
- Do maintain strict typing and error handling
- Do not change package manager or versions casually
- Prefer small commits and PRs
