#### Deployment Steps

For complete deployment instructions, see **[RAILWAY_QUICK_REFERENCE.md](RAILWAY_QUICK_REFERENCE.md)** or **[docs/RAILWAY_RAILPACK_CHEATSHEET.md](docs/RAILWAY_RAILPACK_CHEATSHEET.md)**.

**Quick Steps:**
1. **Pre-deployment validation**: Run `yarn railway:validate`
2. **Configure Railway services**: Set root directories for each service
3. **Set environment variables**: Add required variables per service
4. **Deploy**: Push to GitHub - Railway auto-deploys from main branch

#### Build Commands

The workspace includes optimized build commands:
- `yarn build` - Builds both frontend and backend
- `yarn build:frontend` - Builds frontend only
- `yarn build:backend` - Builds backend only
- `yarn railway:validate` - Validate Railway/Railpack configuration files
- `yarn deploy:check` - Verify deployment readiness

#### Railway Troubleshooting

For Railway deployment issues:
1. **Quick Reference**: See [RAILWAY_QUICK_REFERENCE.md](RAILWAY_QUICK_REFERENCE.md)
2. **Comprehensive Guide**: See [docs/RAILWAY_RAILPACK_CHEATSHEET.md](docs/RAILWAY_RAILPACK_CHEATSHEET.md)
3. **Step-by-step**: See [RAILWAY_DEPLOYMENT_CHECKLIST.md](RAILWAY_DEPLOYMENT_CHECKLIST.md)
4. **Validate Configs**: Run `yarn railway:validate` to check configuration files

Common solutions in the comprehensive guide include:
- Fixing "Install inputs must be an image or step input" errors
- Resolving "No project found in /app" issues
- Health check timeout configuration
- Port binding patterns for all services

## Architecture

The application is built with a modular architecture:

- **Core Components**: React-based UI components
- **Context Providers**: State management using React Context API
- **Services**: API integrations and data processing
- **Hooks**: Custom React hooks for business logic
- **ML Models**: TensorFlow.js-based machine learning models
- **Extension Integration**: Chrome extension communication layer

## Advanced Trading Features

### Machine Learning Trading

The ML trading system uses historical data to predict market movements:

- Feature engineering from market data
- Model training with adjustable parameters
- Prediction confidence scoring
- Automated trade execution based on predictions

### Deep Q-Network Trading

The DQN trading system uses reinforcement learning:

- State representation of market conditions
- Action space for trading decisions
- Reward function based on profit/loss
- Experience replay for improved learning
- Target network for stable training

### Model Recalibration

The model recalibration system prevents overfitting:

- Performance monitoring over time
- Automatic detection of model drift
- Periodic retraining with new data
- Hyperparameter optimization
- Confidence calibration

## Chrome Extension Integration

The Chrome extension provides additional functionality:

- Real-time notifications
- Quick trading actions
- Market monitoring
- Custom alerts

## Dependency Management (Yarn Berry & Corepack) and Node Versioning

### Node.js Version Consistency
This project uses Node.js. The required version is specified in the `engines` field in `package.json` (e.g., `>=20.0.0`) and is also used in the `backend.Dockerfile`.

### Yarn Berry and Corepack
This project uses Yarn Berry (version specified in `package.json`'s `packageManager` field). Corepack, which is bundled with Node.js v16.10+, is used to manage the Yarn version.

**Local Development Setup:**
1.  Ensure you have Node.js installed (version matching `engines.node` in `package.json`).
2.  Enable Corepack for Yarn (if not already enabled):
    ```bash
    corepack enable yarn
    ```
3.  Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    yarn install
    ```
    Corepack will automatically use the Yarn Berry version specified in `package.json`.

**Updating Dependencies or Node Version:**
When changing the Node.js version (locally, in Dockerfile, or `package.json` `engines`) or updating dependencies:
1.  Ensure your local development environment matches the intended Node.js version.
2.  Run `yarn install` to update dependencies and the `yarn.lock` file.
3.  Commit the updated `yarn.lock` file (and `package.json` if dependencies changed) to the repository.

This practice ensures that dependency resolution is consistent. The `yarn install --immutable` command used in Docker builds relies on an up-to-date and consistent `yarn.lock` file generated by the correct Yarn version.

## Security & Deployment Notes

### Environment Variables & Secrets
- **All secrets must be configured via environment variables** (see `.env.example`)
- **Never commit API keys or secrets to the repository**
- JWT secrets must be changed from default values for production
- Use Railway's secret management for sensitive values in production

### Health Check Requirements
- **Backend**: `/api/health` and `/healthz` endpoints must be live for Railway monitoring
- **Frontend**: `/healthz` endpoint configured for Railway health checks
- **ML Worker**: `/health` and `/healthz` endpoints configured for monitoring
- Health check timeout configured to 300 seconds for all services

### CORS Policy
The application enforces strict CORS policies for security:
- **Allowed Origins**: Only trusted frontend URLs are permitted
- **Methods**: `GET`, `POST` only
- **Credentials**: `true` for cookie-based authentication
- **Production**: CORS must restrict to trusted frontend origins only
- **Development**: Includes localhost origins for local development

CORS origins are configured via:
- `FRONTEND_URL` environment variable for primary frontend
- `CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS` for multiple trusted domains
- Railway reference variables for dynamic domain resolution

### Deployment Security Checklist
- [ ] All API keys and secrets configured via environment variables
- [ ] JWT secrets changed from default values  
- [ ] Health check endpoints responding correctly
- [ ] CORS restricted to trusted origins only
- [ ] Database connections using Railway managed URLs
- [ ] No hardcoded credentials in source code

### Railway-Specific Security
- Use Railway reference variables for service communication: `${{service.RAILWAY_PUBLIC_DOMAIN}}`
- Internal traffic uses `.railway.internal` domains
- Public traffic uses HTTPS-only endpoints
- Database connections use `${{Postgres.DATABASE_URL}}` references
