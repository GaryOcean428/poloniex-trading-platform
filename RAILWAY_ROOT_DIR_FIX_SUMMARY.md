# Railway Deployment Root Directory Fix - Complete Summary

## Problem Statement

Railway deployments were failing with these errors:

### ML Worker Service
```
ERROR: Could not open requirements file: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: 'requirements.txt'
Build Failed: bc.Build: failed to solve: process "sh -c .venv/bin/pip install -r requirements.txt" did not complete successfully: exit code: 1
```

### Backend Service
```
Usage Error: No project found in /app
$ yarn install [--json] [--immutable] [--immutable-cache]
Build Failed: bc.Build: failed to solve: process "sh -c cd /app && yarn install --immutable --immutable-cache" did not complete successfully: exit code: 1
```

## Root Cause Analysis

The railpack.json configuration files contained commands assuming execution from repository root (`/app`), but Railway's Root Directory setting changes the execution context to service subdirectories.

## Solution Summary

### Code Changes (Completed ✅)

1. **backend/railpack.json**
   - Install: `cd /app` → `cd ..` (go to parent for workspace)
   - Build: Added missing `node scripts/flatten-dist.mjs` step
   - Start: `node backend/dist/src/index.js` → `node dist/index.js`
   - Removed non-schema fields
   - Added proper step dependencies

2. **frontend/railpack.json**
   - Install: `cd /app` → `cd ..` (consistency)

3. **python-services/poloniex/railpack.json**
   - Start: `/app/.venv/bin/python` → `.venv/bin/python` (relative path)

4. **Documentation Added**
   - `RAILWAY_FIX_GUIDE.md` - Technical guide with troubleshooting
   - `RAILWAY_ACTION_CHECKLIST.md` - Quick setup checklist

### Railway Configuration Required (User Action ⚠️)

Each service needs Root Directory set in Railway UI:
- **Backend**: `./backend`
- **Frontend**: `./frontend`
- **ML Worker**: `./python-services/poloniex`

All command overrides must be cleared (Build/Install/Start should be empty).

## Expected Results

After user configures Railway:
- ✅ Backend builds with workspace dependencies
- ✅ Frontend builds with workspace dependencies
- ✅ ML Worker installs from local requirements.txt
- ✅ All services start with correct paths

## Files Changed

- `backend/railpack.json` (10 lines: -8, +6)
- `frontend/railpack.json` (2 lines: -1, +1)
- `python-services/poloniex/railpack.json` (2 lines: -1, +1)
- `RAILWAY_FIX_GUIDE.md` (138 lines added)
- `RAILWAY_ACTION_CHECKLIST.md` (102 lines added)

**Total**: 5 files, 254 insertions, 10 deletions

## Testing & Validation

- ✅ JSON validation passed (jq)
- ✅ Path resolution verified
- ✅ Code review completed
- ✅ Security scan passed (CodeQL)
- ✅ No new vulnerabilities

## Next Steps

User must:
1. Configure Root Directory for each service in Railway UI
2. Clear any command overrides
3. Deploy and verify success indicators in logs
