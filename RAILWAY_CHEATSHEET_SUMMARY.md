## Key Features of the Comprehensive Cheatsheet

### 1. Project-Specific Configuration ✅

All examples use actual project configuration:
- **Frontend**: React 19 + Vite, Node 20, Yarn 4.9.2, port 5675
- **Backend**: Node 20 + Express + TypeScript, port 8765
- **Python**: Python 3.13.2 + FastAPI, port 9080

### 2. Verified Railpack Configurations ✅

Includes current working configurations from:
- `frontend/railpack.json` - with Corepack and Vite build
- `backend/railpack.json` - with TypeScript compilation and flatten-dist
- `python-services/poloniex/railpack.json` - with virtual environment setup

### 3. Comprehensive Troubleshooting ✅

Covers actual issues encountered in past deployments:
- "Install inputs must be an image or step input"
- "No project found in /app"
- Health check timeouts
- Frontend blank page issues
- TypeScript build failures with shared dependencies

### 4. Health Check Implementation ✅

Detailed health check patterns for each service:
- Frontend: `/healthz` with comprehensive validation (HealthChecker class)
- Backend: `/api/health` with uptime and status
- Python: `/health` with service metadata

### 5. Port Binding Patterns ✅

Actual code examples from the project:
- Frontend: `serve.js` with `parseInt(process.env.PORT || '5675', 10)`
- Backend: Express with `process.env.PORT || 8765`
- Python: FastAPI with `uvicorn --host 0.0.0.0 --port $PORT`

### 6. Monorepo-Specific Patterns ✅

Documents the shared dependency bundling pattern:
- `prebuild.mjs` script usage
- `bundle-shared.mjs` for cross-service shared code
- Workspace-aware build commands

### 7. Railway Service Details ✅

Includes actual Railway service IDs:
- polytrade-fe: `c81963d4-f110-49cf-8dc0-311d1e3dcf7e`
- polytrade-be: `e473a919-acf9-458b-ade3-82119e4fabf6`
- ml-worker: `86494460-6c19-4861-859b-3f4bd76cb652`

### 8. Security Best Practices ✅

Covers project-specific security:
- Environment variable patterns
- CORS configuration with Railway reference variables
- JWT secret generation
- No secrets in railpack.json
