openssl rand -base64 32
```

### 2. Configure Railway

Set these environment variables in Railway:

**Required:**
- `JWT_SECRET` - From step 1
- `API_ENCRYPTION_KEY` - From step 1
- `DATABASE_URL` - From Railway Postgres plugin
- `FRONTEND_URL` - Your frontend domain
- `VITE_API_URL` - Your backend domain
- `NODE_ENV=production`

**Optional:**
- `POLONIEX_API_KEY` - For live trading
- `POLONIEX_API_SECRET` - For live trading
- `CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS` - Additional CORS origins

### 3. Service Configuration

| Service | Root Directory | Config File |
|---------|----------------|-------------|
| Frontend | `./frontend` | `frontend/railpack.json` |
| Backend | `./backend` | `backend/railpack.json` |
| ML Worker | `./python-services/poloniex` | `python-services/poloniex/railpack.json` |

### 4. Deploy

```bash
# Validate before deploying
yarn deploy:check

# Push to trigger deployment
git push origin main
```

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Issue: Routes return 404

**Solution:** SPA fallback is already implemented. Ensure:
- Frontend is built (`yarn build:frontend`)
- `FRONTEND_STANDALONE` is correctly set
- Backend can find frontend dist at `../../frontend/dist`

### Issue: CORS errors

**Solution:** 
- Set `FRONTEND_URL` in Railway
- Check `CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS` includes your domain
- Verify origin in browser matches allowed origins

### Issue: Health check fails

**Solution:**
- Verify service is running
- Check Railway logs for errors
- Ensure `PORT` environment variable is set
- Verify health check path in Railway settings
