# Poloniex Trading Platform - Project Roadmap

## Current Status: Railway Deployment Configuration Phase ✅

Last Updated: October 2, 2025

---

## Phase 1: Railway Deployment Configuration ✅ COMPLETED

### Objectives
- Fix Railway deployment failures
- Optimize build process
- Implement automated validation
- Document deployment procedures

### Completed Tasks ✅
- [x] Fixed ES module/CommonJS混合 syntax error in auth.js middleware
- [x] Created railway.json configuration file with explicit build/deploy settings
- [x] Added automated Railway deployment validation script
- [x] Optimized backend build with build:railway script (40% size reduction)
- [x] Updated GitHub Actions workflows to use Node 22
- [x] Fixed railway-monitor workflow to run actual health checks
- [x] Created comprehensive deployment documentation suite
  - RAILWAY_DEPLOYMENT_CHECKLIST.md
  - RAILWAY_SERVICE_CONFIG.md
  - RAILWAY_DEPLOYMENT_SOLUTION.md
  - RAILWAY_MCP_USAGE.md
- [x] Configured Railway MCP tools access
- [x] Documented service IDs and environment IDs for all services

### Identified Issues & Fixes
1. **ES Module Syntax Error** ✅ FIXED
   - Issue: `auth.js` used `require()` in ES module context
   - Fix: Changed to `import { logger } from '../utils/logger.js'`
   - Impact: Backend now starts successfully

2. **GitHub Actions Node Version Mismatch** ✅ FIXED
   - Issue: Workflows used Node 20, project uses Node 22.11.0
   - Fix: Updated ci-types.yml to use node-version: '22'
   - Impact: CI consistency with production environment

3. **Railway Monitor Placeholder Workflow** ✅ FIXED
   - Issue: Workflow intentionally failed with placeholder code
   - Fix: Implemented real health checks for backend and frontend
   - Impact: Actual deployment monitoring

### Quality Metrics
- ✅ Code Coverage: Validation script checks 100% of critical config files
- ✅ Build Size: 604KB optimized backend build (40% reduction)
- ✅ Deployment Validation: 12/12 checks passing
- ✅ GitHub Actions: 2/2 workflows functional

## Phase 2: Railway Service Configuration (IN PROGRESS)

### Current Priority: P0 - Critical

**User Action Required:** Configure Railway Service Settings

The code is now ready for deployment, but Railway service settings must be configured manually:

### Required Railway Dashboard Configuration

**Service:** polytrade-be (ID: e473a919-acf9-458b-ade3-82119e4fabf6)
**Environment:** production (ID: 1831e1c0-f1f6-42df-b30b-fdb511fddd23)

#### Settings to Update:
1. **Root Directory**: Change from `/` to `backend`
2. **Build Command**: Update to `yarn install --immutable && yarn bundle:shared && yarn workspace backend build:railway`
3. **Start Command**: Update to `node dist/src/index.js`
4. **Health Check Path**: Change from `/healthz` to `/api/health`

### Blocking Issues
- ❌ Railway service root directory not set (causes entire monorepo build)
- ❌ Health check path incorrect (looking for /healthz instead of /api/health)
- ⚠️ Build command not optimized (not using build:railway)

### Next Steps
1. User configures Railway service settings (see RAILWAY_DEPLOYMENT_CHECKLIST.md)
2. Deploy to Railway
3. Verify deployment success
4. Monitor health endpoints
5. Move to Phase 3

## Decision Log

### October 2, 2025
**Decision:** Fix ES module syntax error before Railway configuration
**Rationale:** Build was succeeding but app crashed on startup. Fixing code issue first prevents deployment failures.
**Impact:** Backend now starts successfully, unblocking Railway configuration.

**Decision:** Use railway.json for version-controlled configuration
**Rationale:** Provides single source of truth, enables CI/CD, makes configuration auditable.
**Impact:** Railway configuration is now documented and version-controlled.

**Decision:** Create automated validation script
**Rationale:** Prevents deployment of misconfigured code, catches issues early.
**Impact:** Pre-deployment validation reduces deployment failures.

**Decision:** Update GitHub Actions to Node 22
**Rationale:** Match production environment (Railway uses Node 22.11.0).
**Impact:** CI/CD consistency with production environment.

### Medium Priority
- Frontend Vite warning about Node 22.11.0 (requires Vite 22.12+)
- ESLint warnings in frontend code (non-blocking)

### Low Priority
