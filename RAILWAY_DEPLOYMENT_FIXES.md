# Railway Deployment Fixes Applied

## Issues Fixed

### 1. **Python Detection Issue** ✅
**Problem**: Railway was detecting Python instead of Node.js due to `main.py` and `backend_test.py` in root
**Solution**: Moved Python files to `tests/` directory to prevent misdetection

### 2. **Yarn Not Found** ✅  
**Problem**: `sh: 1: yarn: not found` during build
**Solution**: Added explicit corepack enable and yarn preparation in railpack.json build steps

### 3. **Railpack Configuration** ✅
**Problem**: Incorrect railpack.json format causing build failures
**Solution**: Updated all railpack.json files to use proper Railway-compatible format

### 4. **Node.js Version** ✅
**Problem**: Inconsistent Node.js version detection
**Solution**: Updated .nvmrc to specify exact version `20.19.5`

## Files Modified

### Railpack Configurations
- `/railpack.json` - Root service configuration
- `/backend/railpack.json` - Backend Node.js service  
- `/frontend/railpack.json` - Frontend React service
- `/python-services/poloniex/railpack.json` - ML Worker Python service

### Environment Files
- `.nvmrc` - Node.js version specification
- `.railwayignore` - Railway-specific ignore rules

### File Relocations
- `main.py` → `tests/main.py`
- `backend_test.py` → `tests/backend_test.py`

## Key Railway Compliance Features

### ✅ Proper PORT Binding
- Backend binds to `0.0.0.0:${PORT}` 
- Frontend serves on `0.0.0.0:${PORT}`
- ML Worker binds to `0.0.0.0:${PORT}`

### ✅ Health Check Endpoints
- Backend: `/api/health`
- Frontend: `/` (root)
- ML Worker: `/health`

### ✅ Build System
- Single railpack.json configuration (no competing Dockerfiles)
- Proper Yarn Berry 4.9.2 setup with corepack
- Immutable installs for production consistency

### ✅ Service Architecture
- Monorepo with proper service isolation
- Each service has its own railpack.json
- Root railpack.json coordinates services

## Deployment Commands

The services should now deploy successfully with:

```bash
# Railway will automatically:
1. Detect Node.js via .nvmrc and package.json
2. Use railpack.json configurations
3. Install Yarn 4.9.2 via corepack
4. Run immutable yarn install
5. Execute yarn build
6. Start services with proper commands
```

## Verification Steps

1. **Build Detection**: Railway should detect Node.js (not Python)
2. **Yarn Installation**: Corepack should successfully install Yarn 4.9.2
3. **Dependency Install**: `yarn install --immutable` should complete
4. **Build Process**: `yarn build` should generate dist folders
5. **Service Start**: All services should bind to Railway-provided PORT
6. **Health Checks**: All health endpoints should return 200 status

## Railway Environment Variables

The following are automatically provided by Railway:
- `PORT` - Service port (automatically assigned)
- `RAILWAY_PUBLIC_DOMAIN` - Public service URL
- `RAILWAY_PRIVATE_DOMAIN` - Internal service communication
- `NODE_ENV=production` - Production environment

## Next Steps

1. Commit these changes to your git repository
2. Push to the Railway-connected branch
3. Railway should automatically redeploy with the fixes
4. Monitor deployment logs for successful completion

All configurations now follow Railway best practices and the deployment should complete successfully.
